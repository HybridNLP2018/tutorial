# HybridNLP2018 - Tutorial on Hybrid Techniques for Knowledge-based NLP
## Knowledge graphs meet machine learning and all their friends

This repo contains the notebooks and overall materials of the HybridNLP 2018 tutorial (http://expertsystemlab.com/hybridNLP18/)

Overal description of the tutorial: Many different artificial intelligence techniques can be used to explore and exploit large document corpora that are available inside organizations and on the Web. While natural language is symbolic in nature and the first approaches in the field were based on symbolic and rule-based methods, like ontologies, semantic networks and knowledge bases, many of the most widely used methods are currently based on statistical approaches. Each of these two main schools of thought in natural language processing, knowledge-based and statistical, have their limitations and strengths and there is an increasing trend that seeks to combine them in complementary ways to get the best of both worlds.

This tutorial covers the foundations and modern practical applications of knowledge-based and statistical methods, techniques and models and their combination for exploiting large document corpora. The tutorial will first focus on the foundations that can be used to this purpose, including knowledge graphs and word embeddings, and will then show how these techniques can be effectively combined in NLP tasks (and other data modalities in addition to text) related to research and commercial projects where the instructors currently participate.

## How to run the tutorial notebooks:
